      <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effect Demonstration</h2>
      <p>
        Parallax is the apparent displacement of an object because of a change in the observer's point of view. 
        It is a phenomenon that is commonly observed in astronomy, where it is used to measure the distance of stars from Earth. 
        When viewed from different positions, the position of the star appears to shift slightly due to the change in the observer's perspective. 
        This shift is known as parallax.

        Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. 
        These instruments use parallax to adjust for the differences in perspective and ensure that the image remains in focus. 
        For example, in a rifle scope, the reticle must be aligned with the barrel of the gun to ensure accuracy, and parallax correction is used to compensate for any errors in alignment.

        Many animals, along with humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis. 
        In computer vision, the effect is used for computer stereo vision, where two cameras are used to capture images from slightly different angles to create a 3D image. 
        There is also a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses parallax to find range and altitude to a target. 
        It works by measuring the angle of the object from two different positions and using trigonometry to calculate the distance.
